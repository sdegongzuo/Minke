# DeepSeek Harness runtime patches

Minke keeps `vendor/deepseek-harness` pinned and pristine. Local fixes that cannot be accepted upstream are declared in `config/harness-runtime.json` and applied only to the disposable staged runtime after workspace deployment.

The applicator accepts git unified diffs that modify existing text files below `node_modules/@deepseek-ai/`. It rejects path escapes, file creation/deletion, renames, binary patches, stale hunks, and skipped patches. Patch contents are part of the runtime fingerprint and metadata; validation also reverse-checks that every declared patch is present before publishing or fast refresh.

`win32-directory-picker.patch` is pinned to Harness `dsh-v0.1.3-alpha.1` (`d347e703908d0406b7a7ef80e3a0e594d86b2215`). It:

- routes the directory dialog worker and Windows ACL sandbox runner through `MINKE_NODE_EXECUTABLE`, with Electron Node mode explicitly restored for the dialog worker;
- keeps the dialog worker's IPC channel open through non-terminal `showing` progress and disconnects only after a terminal result;
- decodes the selected UTF-16 path through `koffi.decode.string16`, avoiding the external `ArrayBuffer` crash in packaged Electron while preserving code points such as `U+5F00`.

`windows-background-processes.patch` is pinned to the same Harness commit. It:

- fills the remaining console-window suppression gaps in Windows process inspection, sandbox probes, browser handoff, plugin management, and the experimental Python runtime;
- retains upstream's hidden `taskkill` helpers and makes its injectable subprocess spawner's `windowsHide` value explicitly `true` for the staged-artifact audit;
- leaves PTY/ConPTY terminal sessions on their dedicated `spawnTerminal` lifecycle path.

After applying that static source patch, staging enumerates every JavaScript
artifact actually deployed by `dsh-sandbox-windows-acl` and hides each
restricted-token child with
`STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW | STARTF_USESTDHANDLES` and `SW_HIDE`. This transform is
deliberately independent of generated `types-<hash>.js` names, which differ
between platform-specific dependency closures. The staged-artifact AST audit
then rejects any direct or restricted launch site that remains visible,
including injectable spawners whose fallback is `node:child_process`.

`optional-plugin-isolation.patch` is pinned to the same Harness commit. It:

- marks entries inserted by profile bundles listed in the profile's `dependencies` as isolated, while installation-owned bundles and launcher overlays remain fail-fast;
- skips external profile bundles selected by Minke's disabled-plugin policy or safe mode without changing the profile manifest;
- retains a failed external entry as Loader health state, logs its original activation error, and lets unrelated entries finish booting;
- exposes isolated activation failures as `failed` through the existing plugin inventory so Settings can report the degraded plugin.

`dynamic-trusted-hosts.patch` is pinned to the same Harness commit. It:

- keeps one mutable trusted-host policy behind the existing Connection service so registered HTTP, WebSocket, and RPC routes observe an atomic replacement;
- validates every replacement before changing the live policy and retains the loopback-only fence for privileged methods;
- lets Minke apply an exact authority through its private parent-child process channel without restarting Harness.

`process-environment-boundaries.patch` is pinned to the same Harness commit. It:

- strips Electron/Node bootstrap controls from ordinary subprocesses, native integrations, and browser handoff children so ambient desktop runtime state cannot leak across execution boundaries;
- restores Minke's managed Node executable and bootstrap only for an explicitly recognized embedded-Node launch, including terminal and Windows ACL paths;
- preserves upstream's `proxyEnvironmentForChild()` overlay after scrubbing, so children retain the configured proxy routing.

`run-code-error-hints.patch` is pinned to the same Harness commit. It:

- appends a recovery hint to `run_code` failure messages whose underlying exception is `ReferenceError: require is not defined`, so the model learns immediately that `run_code` programs have no `require()` and must use `await import("node:...")` or the injected `tools.*` bindings instead of burning steps on blind retries.

The former Details layout/presentation patches remain removed at this pin.
Harness owns adaptive conversation width, the native top-level `details` slot,
and Harness's whole-session turn rail with deep-history load-and-jump; Minke
Tabs uses only `ILayout.openDetails/closeDetails`. The former subagent route
patch also stays removed because Harness natively resolves the effective parent
provider, model, and reasoning effort.

The earlier 0.1.2-alpha.3 release removes only Harness's optional SQLite Session persistence backend.
Minke's IM Gateway SQLite mailbox is a separate desktop transport store and is
not part of that Session persistence contract.

The 0.1.3-alpha.1 runtime uses Session v2 and lifecycle-scoped SessionHandles.
Minke delegates Session creation, inspection, follow streams, and export to
SessionController; Harness owns locking and adjacent v0/v1 migrations, which
retain committed predecessor logs. Staging rebuilds the `fs-ext` lease addon
for the installed Electron version after copying the dependency tree, then
checks that Electron can load it before publication and reuse. The upstream release notes report a known
responsiveness regression in some scenarios; this pin retains that limitation.

After changing the upstream pin or a patch, run:

```sh
pnpm harness:verify
pnpm harness:stage
pnpm test:desktop
```
